        <p>GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab commit and pull request compatible</p>
        <p>Just paste the GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab commit, pull request or merge request url
          or any other git or unified compatible diff and we will render a pretty html representation of it
          with code syntax highlight and line similarity matching for better code reviews.

            <b>Why should I use this instead of GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab?</b>
            <p>Code Syntax Highlight</p>
            <p>Line similarity match (similar lines are together)</p>
            <p>Line by Line and Side by Side (SOON) diffs</p>
            <p>Supports any git and unified compatible diffs</p>
            <p>Easy code selection</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>What urls are supported?</b>
            <p>Any GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab Commit, Pull Request or Merge Request urls.</p>
            <p>Any Git or Unified Raw Diff or Patch urls.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Can I send a custom url for a friend, colleague or co-worker?</b>
            <p>Just add a url parameter called diff to current url using as value your Commit, Pull Request, Merge Request, Diff or Patch url.</p>
            <p>ex: <a href="url.html?diff=https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html/pull/106">https://diff2html.xyz/url?diff=https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html/pull/106</a></p>
            <p>You can also use an hashtag (# or #! or #!/) in the end of the url.
              This will be overridden if you click any href id and for that reason not advised.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Why can't I paste a diff?</b>
            <p><a href="https://diffy.org/">diffy.org</a> is an amazing tool created by <a href="https://github.com/pbu88">pbu88</a>
              to share your diffs and uses diff2html under the hood.</p>
            <p>Also, diff2html cli can directly publish diffs to <a href="https://diffy.org/">diffy.org</a></p>
          </li>
