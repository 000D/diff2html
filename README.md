# Diff to Html by [rtfpessoa](https://github.com/rtfpessoa)

Diff to Html generates pretty HTML diffs from regular command line tools output.

### Inspiration

This project is inspired in [pretty-diff](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff) by [Scott GonzÃ¡lez](https://github.com/scottgonzalez).
This project started with some code from `pretty-diff` but it was then re-written and is now a
browser library.

## Features

* line-by-line diff (not side-by-side)

* new and old line numbers

* GitHub like style

## Setup

> Simply import the diff2html.js invoke:

    var diff2Html = Diff2Html.getInstance();
    diff2Html.generatePrettyDiff(exInput);

> Check out the `template.html` for a complete example.
